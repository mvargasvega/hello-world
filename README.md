# hello-world
My first repository


Hello Martin!

This is your past self letting you know that I don't know anything at the moment. Github and slack are a foreign concept, and you barely feel confident with some of the language that is being used. But, hey hopefully by the time you read this, you will have a developer job or doeing job.

Here is the date that this was written on ( 6/21/17). 

You have been dropped from two programs and now you are navigating the world of being self taught.

Congratulatinos on where you have made it!

Salary at the moment: Roughly 10km 13hr, 10-15 hr a week, and no health insureance =(
